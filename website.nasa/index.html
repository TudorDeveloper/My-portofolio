<p>
The <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank">Mars Perseverance</a> rover mission is part of <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA's Mars Exploration Program</a>, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The Mars Perseverance mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key questions about the potential for life on Mars. The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life itself. The Mars Perseverance rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a "cache" on the surface of Mars. </p> </br>
</div>
  <div class="text2">
    <p>
The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate 
<a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/" target="_blank">technologies</a> that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/#EDL-Tech"
target="_blank">improving landing techniques</a>, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.</p> </br>
</div>
<div class="text3">
<p> 
The rover is set to land on Mars in <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/science/landing-site/" target="_blank">Jezero Crater</a> 
on Feb. 18, 2021.
